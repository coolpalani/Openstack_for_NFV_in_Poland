(11:15:43) Chaitanya Shastri is requesting to view and control your computer.
	Would you like to Allow or Refuse?

(11:15:44) Chaitanya Shastri can now view and control the customer's screen.

(11:15:53) You said to everyone:
i'm trying

(11:16:09) Chen Chen said to everyone:
Hi Robin I have to leave now. I'm transfering the session to you.

(11:16:18) This session has been transferred to Robin Cernin.

(11:16:44) Chen Chen said to everyone:
Hi Jun I'm leaving now. I will check wechat now and then after the work.

(11:16:45) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
ok

(11:17:19) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
So this is not able to deploy because it does not get the DHCP assigned IP?

(11:17:20) You said to everyone:
my telphone is +8618680356499  , maybe it is useful

(11:17:26) You said to everyone:
yes .


(11:18:22) Chen Chen said to everyone:
Robin: the tap device inside the netns can not receive the DHCP Request

(11:19:08) Chen Chen said to everyone:
The summary in the case is updated.


(14:00:47) You said to everyone:
oh,  I  find the system has been changed ,  did you change ?

(14:01:06) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
Nope. must have been changed when you deleted the ports probably

(14:01:07) You said to everyone:
for example  ovs bridge and ctlplane network

(14:01:13) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
neutron creates the ports in OVS

(14:02:18) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
after this

(14:02:41) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
I want to do tcpdump on br-ctlplane phys interface and the tap device in dhcp namespace



(14:16:35) You said to everyone:
the issue has been resolved.

(14:16:47) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
how come we didn't see it. I wonder how this happened.

(14:17:03) You said to everyone:
it is caused by  ctlplane's  property

(14:17:08) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
because it is flat by default.

(14:17:13) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
I dont understand how you get local.

(14:17:42) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
aha!

(14:17:50) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
heat stack-delete doesn't DELETE the ctrlplane

(14:17:57) You said to everyone:
Maybe  delete ctlplane and create manually .

(14:18:02) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
so the manual delete helped to create it flat ?

(14:18:13) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
yeah

(14:18:30) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
it must have been that since the heat doesn't delete the ctlplane network

(14:19:40) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1343649

(14:19:41) You said to everyone:
sometimes  heat stack-delete failed , so I manually delete ports or networks to delete the stack sucessfully.

(14:25:21) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
it is ipxe_timeout sorry

(14:28:56) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
so the problem wasn't in tripleo at all.

(14:28:59) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
so it was in neutron

(14:29:09) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
in the ctlplane network

(14:29:19) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
We didn't check that one :-/

(14:29:23) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
we checked everything else tho..

(14:30:01) You said to everyone:
yes, it is caused by wrong manually operation, I feel regretful .

w

(14:35:23) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
It's always not to Keyboard Interrupt if you ask me

(14:35:29) You said to everyone:
why it cause wrong operation?   often I abort the installation process  and cause some left , we should wait the command finished natually.

(14:35:36) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
since there is not much logic in the rollback mechanisms.

(14:35:46) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
some commands has abort or rollback implemented.

(14:35:51) Robin Cernin said to everyone:
But might be that not all
